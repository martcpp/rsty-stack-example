1. **Build Your Rocket Application**: Run `cargo build --release` in your project directory. This will compile your code into an optimized binary.

2. 1. **RUN Your Rocket Application**: Run `cargo RUN` in your project directory. This will compile your code into an optimized binary.

3. **Navigate to the Target Directory**: After building successfully, navigate to the target directory where the executable is located. It's usually located in `target/release/`.

4. **Run the Executable**: Execute the binary file by running `./your_executable_name`. Replace `your_executable_name` with the name of your binary file. This will start your Rocket server.

5. **Access Your API**: Once the server is running, you can access your API using the specified routes. If you're running it locally, you can access it at `http://localhost:8000/`, where `<port>` is the port you configured in your Rocket application.
